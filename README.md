# CorreLAter

## Inspiration
With the multitude of data sets provided by LA City and LA County, it's can be difficult to read between the lines and get down to the real issues.

## How it works
Our platform allows for users to upload different data sets from the LA databases and test different hypothesis in order to find statistical significances or correlations.  

## Challenges we ran into
Data sets come in all shapes and sizes, making difficult to create a scalable platform on which to interpret any kind of data, which required intensive data screening and formatting. Though the statistical validity is of possible question, this platform is meant to ask more question not find all the answers

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
This platform enables Angelenos to think outside the box about pressing issues surrounding the drought.
